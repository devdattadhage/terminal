1. A program running on a computer is called process.
2. There are different processes that launch other processes, and those are called parent process of child processes.
3. If the parent process is killed then all the child processes also dies.
4. `Activity Monitor` you can monitor all the processes here. Its just like windows `task manager`.
5. `brew install pstree` --> `pstree` shows all processes in tree-like structure. `pstree -p PID` to see specific process.
6. `--help` its shows all kinds of action you can perform on specific command. Print usage and this help message and exit.
